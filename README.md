Little set of Python libs that I use in multiple projects.

- *arch*: guess "64-bitness" of system or Python interpreter.
- *bin*: handy binary file reading methods
- *conc*: threading helpers
- *enc*: help to guess encoding of a file
- *exe*: functions related to Windows PE files
- *format*: pretty formatting of various kind of data
- *log*: cross-platform coloured root logger
- *time*: utilities to measure time

TODO
