Little set of Python libs that I use in multiple projects.

- *arch*: guess "64-bitness" of system or Python interpreter.
- *bin*: handy binary file reading methods
- *concurrency*: threading helpers
- *encodings*: help to guess encoding of a file
- *format*: pretty formatting of various kind of data
- *logger*: cross-platform coloured root logger

TODO

- clean read_cstring
- best logger?
